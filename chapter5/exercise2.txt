Chapter 5 Exercise 2

I didn't know exactly how to handle this, so I figured this was the best way to do it

Part 1-2:
1 zippo("rattle", 13); in main
2 if (flag < 0) evaluates to false in zippo
3 System.out.println("ik"); in zippo
4 baffle(quince); in zippo
5 System.out.println(blimp); in baffle
6 zippo("ping", -5); in baffle
7 if (flag < 0) evaluates to true in zippo
8 System.out.printn(quince + " zoop");

Part 3:
The blimp parameter of baffle is "rattle"

Part 4:
The output of the program is "ikrattleping zoop"
